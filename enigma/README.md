# JavaScript Enigma Machine Emulator 
#### [Demo hosted here](https://morgandavid.me/enigma/)

This project emulates an Enigma machine - most famous for being used through WW2 as the main form of long-distance Nazi communication. 

At the time of manufacture this was thought to be an unbreakable encryption system for trasmitting messages over telegraph or radio. This webpage emulates a 1932 steckered Enigma I machine with a plugboard. All the circruitry of this machine is described in detail [in the Turing archive](http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/archive/b/B05/B05-001.html). [codesandciphers.org.uk](https://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/index.htm) is also very helpful in understanding the details of the machine.
